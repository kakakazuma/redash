## How can I contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

When creating a new bug report, please make sure to:

- Search for existing issues first. If you find a previous report of your issue, please update the existing issue with additional information instead of creating a new one.
- If you are not sure if your issue is really a bug or just some configuration/setup problem, please start a discussion in [the support forum](https://discuss.redash.io/c/support) first. Unless you can provide clear steps to reproduce, it's probably better to start with a thread in the forum and later to open an issue.
- If you still decide to open an issue, please review the template and guidelines and include as much details as possible.
 
### Suggesting Enhancements / Feature Requests

If you would like to suggest an enchancement or ask for a new feature:

- Please check [the roadmap](https://trello.com/b/b2LUHU7A/re-dash-roadmap) for existing Trello card for what you want to suggest/ask. If there is, feel free to upvote it to signal interest or add your comments.
- If there is no existing card, open a thread in [the forum](https://discuss.redash.io/c/feature-requests) to start a discussion about what you want to suggest. Try to provide as much details and context as possible and include information about *the problem you want to solve* rather only *your proposed solution*.
 
### Pull Requests

- **Code contributions are welcomed**. For big changes or significant features, it's usually better to reach out first and discuss what you want to implement and how (we recommend reading: [Pull Request First](https://medium.com/practical-blend/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6#.ozlqxvj36)). This to make sure that what you want to implement is aligned with our goals for the project and that no one else is already working on it.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
- Please add [documentation](#documentation) for new features or changes in functionality along with the code.
- Please follow existing code style. We use PEP8 for Python and sensible style for Javascript.
