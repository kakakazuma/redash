Hi there,

We searched for Re:dash accounts you've already joined or are allowed to join, using {{email}} and we found the following:

{% for account in users %}
* {{account.org.name}}: {{ url_for('redash.index', org_slug=account.org.slug, _external=True) }}
{% endfor %}

If you're trying to join a specific account that isn't listed here, you can try contacting your team administrator for an invitation.
You can also try a different email, or forge ahead and create a new team!

Please let us know if you have any other questions or feedback.

Cheers,

Re:dash
