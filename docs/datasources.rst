Supported Data Sources
######################

re:dash supports several types of data sources (see below the full list)
and their management is done with the CLI (``manage.py``):

Create new data source
======================

.. code:: bash

    $ cd /opt/redash/current
    $ sudo -u redash bin/run ./manage.py ds new -n {name} -t {type} -o {options}

If you omit any of the options (-n, -t, -o) it will show a prompt asking
for it. Options is a JSON string with the connection parameters. Unless
you're doing some sort of automation, it's probably easier to leave it
empty and fill out the prompt.

See below for the different supported data sources types and the
relevant options string format.

Listing existing data sources
=============================

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo -u redash bin/run ./manage.py ds list

Supported data sources
======================

PostgreSQL / Redshift
---------------------

-  **Type**: pg
-  **Options**:

   -  User (user)
   -  Password (password)
   -  Host (host)
   -  Port (port)
   -  Database name (dbname) (mandatory)

Note that you need to install the MySQLDb package as it is not included
in the ``requirements.txt`` file.

Graphite
--------

-  **Type**: graphite

   -  Url (url) (mandatory)
   -  User (username)
   -  Password (password)
   -  Verify SSL ceritficate (verify)

-  **Options string format**: '{"url":
   "https://graphite.yourcompany.com", "auth": ["user", "password"],
   "verify": true}'

Google BigQuery
---------------

-  **Type**: bigquery
-  **Options**:

   -  Service Account (serviceAccount) (mandatory)
   -  Project ID (projectId) (mandatory)
   -  Private Key filename (privateKey) (mandatory)

-  **Options string format (for v0.5 and older)**: {"serviceAccount" :
   "43242343247-fjdfakljr3r2@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
   "privateKey" : "/somewhere/23fjkfjdsfj21312-privatekey.p12",
   "projectId" : "myproject-123" }

Notes:

1. To obtain BigQuery credentials follow the guidelines at:
   https://developers.google.com/bigquery/authorization#service-accounts
2. You need to install the ``google-api-python-client``,
   ``oauth2client`` and ``pyopenssl`` packages (PyOpenSSL requires
   ``libffi-dev`` and ``libssl-dev`` packages), as they are not included
   in the ``requirements.txt`` file.

Google Spreadsheets
-------------------

(supported from v0.6.4)

-  **Type**: google\_spreadsheets
-  **Options**:

   -  Credentials filename (credentialsFilePath) (mandatory)

Notes:

1. To obtain Google ServiceAccount credentials follow the guidelines at:
   https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#serviceaccounts (save
   the JSON version of the credentials file)
2. To be able to load the spreadsheet in re:dash - share your it with
   your ServiceAccount's email (it can be found in the credentials json
   file, for example
   43242343247-fjdfakljr3r2@developer.gserviceaccount.com) Note: all the
   service account details can be seen inside the json file you should
   obtain following step #1
3. The query format is "DOC\_UUID\|SHEET\_NUM" (for example
   "kjsdfhkjh4rsEFSDFEWR232jkddsfh\|0")
4. You (might) need to install the ``gspread``, ``oauth2client`` and
   ``dateutil`` packages as they are not included in the
   ``requirements.txt`` file.

MongoDB
-------

-  **Type**: mongo
-  **Options**:

   -  Connection String (connectionString) (mandatory)
   -  Database name (dbName)
   -  Replica set name (replicaSetName)

-  **Options string format (for v0.5 and older)**: { "connectionString"
   : "mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/mydb", "dbName" : "mydb" }

For ReplicaSet databases use the following connection string: \*
**Options string format**: { "connectionString" :
"mongodb://user:pasword@server1:27017,server2:27017/mydb", "dbName" :
"mydb", "replicaSetName" : "myreplicaSet" }

Notes:

1. You need to install ``pymongo``, as it is not included in the
   ``requirements.txt`` file.

URL
---

A URL based data source which requests URLs that conforms to the
supported :doc:`results JSON
format </dev/results_format>`.

Very useful in situations where you want to expose the data without
connecting directly to the database.

The query itself inside re:dash will simply contain the URL to be
executed (i.e. http://myserver/path/myquery)

-  **Type**: url
-  **Options**:

   -  Url (url)

-  **Options string format (optional) (for v0.5 and older)**:
   http://myserver/path/

Notes:

1. All URLs must return the supported :doc:`results JSON
   format </dev/results_format>`.
2. If the Options string is set, only URLs that are part of the supplied
   path can be executed using this data source. Not setting the options
   path allows any URL to be executed as long as it returns the
   supported :doc:`results JSON
   format </dev/results_format>`.

Script
------

Allows executing any executable script residing on the server as long as
its standard output conforms to the supported :doc:`results JSON
format </dev/results_format>`.

This integration is useful in situations where you need more than just a
query and requires some processing to happen.

Once the path to scripts is configured in the datasource the query needs
to contain the file name of the script as well as any command line
parameters the script requires (i.e. myscript.py param1 param2
--param3=value)

-  **Type**: script
-  **Options**:

   -  Scripts Path (path) (mandatory)

-  **Options string format (for v0.5 and older)**: /path/to/scripts/

Notes:

1. You MUST set a path to execute the scripts, otherwise the data source
   will not work.
2. All scripts must be executable, otherwise results won't return
3. The script data source does not allow relative paths in the form of
   "../". You may use a relative sub path such as "./mydir/myscript".
4. All scripts must output to the standard output the supported :doc:`results
   JSON format </dev/results_format>` and
   only that, otherwise the data source will not be able to load the
   data.

Python
------

Execute other queries, manipulate and compute with Python code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python data source allows running Python code in a secure and safe
environment. It won't allow writing files to disk, importing modules
that were not pre-approved in the configuration etc.

One of the benefits of using the Python data source is its ability to
execute queries (or saved queries) which you can store in a variable and
then manipulate/transform/merge with other data and queries.

You can import data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and SciPy.

This saved the trouble of having outside scripts do the synthesis of
data from multiple sources to create a single data set that can then be
used in dashboards.

-  **Type**: Python
-  **Options**:

   -  Allowed Modules in a comma separated list (optional). **NOTE:**
      You MUST make sure these modules are installed on the machine
      running the Celery workers
